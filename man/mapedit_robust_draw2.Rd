\title{Robust interactive geometry drawing using `mapedit`}
\usage{
mapedit_robust_draw2()
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object representing the user-drawn geometry, transformed to
EPSG 4326.
}
\description{
This function provides a robust wrapper around \code{mapedit::drawFeatures()},
allowing a user to interactively draw a geometry and review or repeat the process
before returning a final \code{sf} object.
}
\details{
The function repeatedly prompts the user until a valid geometry is created.
If the user accidentally closes the drawing tool without selecting **Finish**,
or produces \code{NULL}, the function offers an option to restart the process.
After a successful geometry is drawn, the user may visually review it
(via \code{mapview::mapview()}) and optionally redraw the geometry.


This function:
\enumerate{
  \item Launches an interactive map using \code{mapedit::drawFeatures()}.
  \item Catches errors (e.g., forgetting to click "Finish") and prompts the user
  to retry.
  \item Transforms the resulting geometry to EPSG 4326.
  \item Prompts the user to review the geometry and optionally redraw it.
}

Internally, the function uses \code{gauntlet::robust_prompt_used()} to manage
user prompts and yes/no logic.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run the interactive geometry tool
geom <- mapedit_robust_draw2()

# View returned geometry
print(geom)
}
