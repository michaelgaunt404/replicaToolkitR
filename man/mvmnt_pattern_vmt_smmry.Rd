)
}
\arguments{
\item{link_selections_df}{A data frame containing movement pattern and sequence information.}

\item{replica_queried_network}{A data frame containing queried network information.}

\item{location}{The location or directory where data files are stored.}

\item{folder}{The folder within the specified location containing necessary data files.}

\item{include_mode_veh_type}{A logical indicating whether to include mode and vehicle type in the output.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing VMT per mode and vehicle type based on movement and movement sequence.
}
\description{
This function aggregates unique trips along a specific movement pattern and sequence number
by linking two data frames: link_selections_df and replica_queried_network. It calculates
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per mode and vehicle type based on movement and movement sequence.
