\title{Generate Leaflet Map with Recolored Network Links Based on Link Bearing}
\usage{
replica_make_link_bearing_map(sf_network_link)
}
\arguments{
\item{sf_network_link}{A Spatial object (sf) representing network links with a \code{bearing} attribute.
The object must be pre-processed and include the required attributes.}
}
\value{
A Leaflet map with recolored network links based on their bearing.
}
\description{
This function takes a Polyline Spatial object (\code{sf_network_link}) and generates a Leaflet map
with network links colored based on their bearing. The function requires the input object to be
pre-processed and include a \code{bearing} attribute.
}
\details{
The function utilizes the Leaflet package to create an interactive map. It uses the
\code{colorNumeric} function from Leaflet to assign colors to links based on their bearing.
The function assumes that the input object has a \code{bearing} attribute, and this attribute
should be named exactly as "bearing" (hardcoded in the function).
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# sf_network_link <- ... # Load your Spatial object with bearing attribute
# replica_make_link_bearing_map(sf_network_link)
