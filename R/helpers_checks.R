#' Automatically check which Replica links have volumes associated with them.
#'
#' @description This function compares the network links found in the raw network link volume table with those in the acquired Repllica network.
#'
#' This function is ran automatically at the end of the query function but can be ran manually as well.
#'
#' @param location character string pointing to top level location where data acquired from Google was saved to.
#' @param folder character string of name where data was automatically saved to from google data download.
#'
#' @return a returned object detailing which network links were acquired but do not have volumes associated with them.
