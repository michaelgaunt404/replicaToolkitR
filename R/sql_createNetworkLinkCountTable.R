#' Query the count of network links by highway type.
#'
#' This function generates a BigQuery query to calculate the count of network
#' links by highway type using a temporary table created previously.
#'
#' @param customer_name The name of the BigQuery customer project.
#' @param table_network The name of the temporary table containing network data.
#'
#' @return A BigQuery result containing the count of network links by highway type.
